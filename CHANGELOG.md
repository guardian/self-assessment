## [1.0.0] - 2022-02-23
 
### Added
- ðŸŽ‰ The tool now supports Trello integration. In order to make requests to the Trello API, authentication credentials can now be set with the new `--trello-key` and `--trello-token` flags. The parameters are optional, and if neither is set, the tool will only generate a report
containing GitHub pull requests. 
- To support Trello, new structs have been added to the `models` crate.
 
### Changed
- All CLI flags that require the user's input have now been changed from type `String` to `Option<String>` to allow the tool to run even when Trello credentials are not set.
- The Handlebars template now includes a section for Trello boards, which is conditionally rendered based on whether authentication credentials are set.

## [0.1.1] - 2022-02-16
 
### Added
- The tool now outputs descriptive status updates when running.
- The `GuardianPullRequests` enum now implements the `Display` trait.
 
### Changed
- In order to decrease the likelihood of hitting GitHub's secondary rate limit, the logic has been changed so that polling stops once the number of fetched items matches the number of the total items in the response. 
- The `Args` struct now lives in its own module (`cli.rs`).
- The `body` field in the `GithubSearchResponseItem` struct has been changed from a `String` type to an `Option<String>` type to account for empty PR descriptions.

### Fixed
- The new `body` type (`Option<String>`) means that execution no longer halts when encountering a pull request with an empty body.
