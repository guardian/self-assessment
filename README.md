# Guardian Self Assessment CLI tool

## What?
`self-assessment` is a tool that generates a list of PRs authored and reviewed by you.

## Why? 
Assessing oneself is hard - this tool aims to make the process a little bit easier.\
It is not meant to be the be-all and end-all of the self-assessment journey. Use it as a starting point to remember your contributions to the Guardian. 

## Usage

1. Generate a GitHub personal access token ðŸ‘‰ [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new) ðŸ‘ˆ\
Set your preferred expiration date and make sure you grant the **repo** scopes (avoid no expiration). Finally, click "Generate token".\
**NB**: You will need to re-authenticate once the token expires.

2. Set the access token by running the following (replace `<AUTH_TOKEN>` with the generated token).
```shell
cargo run -- --auth-token <AUTH_TOKEN>
```
3. You can now run the CLI tool using the following syntax:

```shell
cargo run -- --from YYYY-MM-DD --to YYYY-MM-DD 
```

If all goes well, you should see an automatically generated HTML page containing useful information about PRs authored and reviewed by you.
