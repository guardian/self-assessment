# Guardian Self Assessment CLI tool

## What?
`self-assessment` is a tool that generates a list of PRs authored and reviewed by you, as well as an optional report of Trello boards and cards you are assigned to.

## Why? 
Assessing oneself is hard - this tool aims to make the process a little bit easier.\
It is not meant to be the be-all and end-all of the self-assessment journey. Use it as a starting point to remember your contributions to the Guardian. 

## How?

1. You need Rust to install `self-assessment`. Running the following command will install the Rust toolchain on your machine. If Rust is already installed, skip this step.
```shell
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

2. Run `cargo install self-assessment` to install or update the CLI tool to the latest version.

3. You can now start using the CLI tool! But first, you need to generate a GitHub personal access token ðŸ‘‰ [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new) ðŸ‘ˆ\
This is required for the tool to access your pull requests in private repositories within the Guardian organisation.\
Set your preferred expiration date and make sure you grant the **repo** scopes (avoid "No expiration" for security reasons). Finally, click "Generate token".\
**NB**: You will need to re-authenticate once the token expires.

4. Set the access token by running the following command (replace `<AUTH_TOKEN>` with the generated token):
```shell
self-assessment --auth-token <AUTH_TOKEN>
```
5. You can now run the CLI tool using the following syntax:

```shell
self-assessment --from <YYYY-MM-DD> --to <YYYY-MM-DD>
```
Both the `--from` and `--to` flags are optional. **If you want to include Trello boards and cards in your report, read the [Trello report section](#trello-report).** \
If no flags are specified (i.e. if you just execute `self-assessment`), you will get a list of all PRs with no time constraints. This is not recommended, as it is likely to incur GitHub's secondary rate limit (particularly if you've been at the Guardian a long time and are a prolific contributor). 
Omitting one of the two flags also works (e.g `self-assessment --from 2021-10-01`).

If all goes well, you should see an automatically generated HTML page containing useful information about PRs authored and reviewed by you.

## Trello report
In order to display the Trello cards your name is assigned to, you need to configure the CLI with a Trello API key and a token.
#### Step 1
You can obtain a key by [logging into Trello](https://trello.com/login) and then visiting https://trello.com/app-key (**please note that this page will throw an error if you are not logged in**).

Once you have obtained a key, run the following command:

```shell
self-assessment --trello-key <TRELLO_KEY>
```

#### Step 2
From the [same page](https://trello.com/app-key), click the link to generate a server token.

You will be taken to a page to generate a sever token, which is set to never expire by default (`authorize?expiration=never`). It is strongly recommended that you change the query parameter in the URL to `authorize?expiration=30days` for security reasons.

Once you have obtained your token, run the following command from the terminal:

```shell
self-assessment --trello-token <TRELLO_TOKEN>
```

Running `self-assessment` from the terminal will now generate a report including Trello cards assigned to you, as well as your authored and reviewed GitHub pull requests. The `--from <YYYY-MM-DD>` and `--to <YYYY--MM-DD>` flags are fully supported.
